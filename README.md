# Redux Store - shopshop

## User Story

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform</br>
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API</br>
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state</br>
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store</br>
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API</br>
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store</br>
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider</br>
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state</br>
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API</br>
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store</br>
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API</br>
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions</br>
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
